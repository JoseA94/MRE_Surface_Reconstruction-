## Data Information

Physical parameters used for simulation:
(https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{110}&space; Particles were treated as single-domain particles interacting each other via dipolar interactions and with a uniform external applied magnetic field along the $z$-direction through a Zeeman interaction. Simulation was performed over 243 magnetite particles of 0.8 $\upmu$m radius, inside a box of 30 $\times$ 30 $\times$10 $\upmu$m$^3$)
